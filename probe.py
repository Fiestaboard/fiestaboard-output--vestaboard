"""The Vestaboard connection check: what a probe's answer means.

Behind :meth:`VestaboardOutput.check_connection`. ``POST /config/board/test``
builds a draft board for the unsaved credentials and serves
``ConnectionCheck.to_verdict()``.

The probe goes through the instance's own request path — ``self.http`` (the
``FIESTABOARD_OUTPUTS_ALLOW_HOSTS`` fence) and the connection's
``(connect, read)`` timeout pair, ``(3, 10)`` local and ``(5, 10)`` cloud. A
board that cannot be connected to is told so after 3 s (5 s cloud).
